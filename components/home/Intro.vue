		<p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
			I'm a Senior Software Engineer from Bangladesh, specializing in building scalable applications with a strong 
			foundation in DevOps practices. 
			<br><br>
			With over 6 years of experience, I focus on engineering best practices, creating maintainable and testable code. 
			I'm particularly passionate about system architecture, API design, and implementing robust solutions that scale. 
			My approach to software development emphasizes both technical excellence and business value.
			<br><br>
			My technical expertise spans across multiple domains:
			<br>
			<b class="text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-100">
				Backend: Python, Go, Node.js, PHP,
				<br>
				Frontend: React.js, Vue.js, Angular
				<br>
				DevOps: AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins
				<br>
				Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, ScyllaDB
			</b>
			<br><br>
			I have extensive experience architecting microservices, implementing XMPP protocols, and managing cloud infrastructure. 
			I've designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and worked extensively with both AWS and Google Cloud 
			platforms for deploying highly available applications.
			<br><br>
			Beyond system architecture, I have a strong foundation in algorithmic problem-solving and competitive programming. 
			I've solved 500+ problems across various online judges, which has sharpened my analytical thinking and ability 
			to optimize complex systems.
			<br><br>
			Currently, I'm focused on:
			<br>
			<b class="text-primary-700 dark:text-primary-100">
				â€¢ Architecting scalable fintech solutions
				<br>
				â€¢ LLM and AI integration in financial services
				<br>
				â€¢ High-performance distributed systems
				<br>
				â€¢ Algorithmic optimization for large-scale applications
			</b>
			<br><br>
			When I'm not engineering solutions, I enjoy participating in coding competitions, exploring emerging technologies, 
			and contributing to the developer community. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with others 
			through mentorship and technical discussions.
